## Introduction

Hello, my name is Jovana and I worked creating a new automation project with [TestCafe tool](https://celestialsys.com/blog/testcafe-a-perfect-automation-tool-for-web-based-applications/#:~:text=Test%20Cafe%20is%20a%20Node,in%20JavaScript%20%5Bor%5D%20TypeScript.) and coded with [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript). The purpose of this project is to navigate through the [Sample page](https://www.saucedemo.com/) using automated test cases to different scenarios as “Login”, “Logout”, “Add items in the shopping cart”, “Complete an order”, etc. This project is organized to use [Page Object Model (POM)](https://medium.com/tech-tajawal/page-object-model-pom-design-pattern-f9588630800b#:~:text=What%20is%20POM%3F,a%20page%20of%20your%20AUT%20
) and [CSS Selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Selectors).
